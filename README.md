Using the API documented here
http://restpack-serializer-sample.herokuapp.com/ write a mobile app that displays a list of artists, 
allows the user to click on an artist to get details about the artist, including a list of albums.
Selecting an album should display a list of songs. The code should be as lean as possible and third party libraries ar 
discouraged but not forbidden.
What We're Looking For.
We're not expecting brilliant looking apps, we're much more interested in functionality and process. 
We would love to see a git/svn repository with the history of how you built it (check-in early and often so 
we can see your thought processes). Document any major decisions you made or choices you took. Working code is 
preferred but non-functional with good testing and an explanation is also welcome.
